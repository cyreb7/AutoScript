# AutoScript
Helpful programming settings, scripts, and resources I find useful in my development environment.

## Using Files
It's recommended that wherever possible you create symlinks to the files in this repositories instead of copying them out. This lets you keep your files up to date with any changes you make or pull from this repository.

## Useful Links
* [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) - my preferred development font
* [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/) - searchable and offline documentation for most programming languages and frameworks
* [CodeCopy](https://github.com/zenorocha/codecopy) - adds a "copy" button to code snippets in the browser
* [Clockwork](https://underground.works/clockwork/) - debug what SQL Laravel is running for each request in dev tools
* [My Keyboard Layout](https://configure.ergodox-ez.com/ergodox-ez/layouts/40KqM/latest/0) - programmable keyboards are awesome

## Contributing
If you have something that makes your everyday development life easier, please feel free to open a PR and add them here. Just try to keep anything overly specific to your setup in its own branch or fork.
